# Raspberry Pi Home Automation and Music System Repository

This repository is a comprehensive storage for code, automation scripts, 3D model files, and more, all dedicated to my Raspberry Pi-based home automation and audio system. This repository is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue to develop and improve my system.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5 4GB
- Waveshare 7" Touchscreen
- Custom 3D-printed enclosure
- m.2 SSD
- Dayton Audio EMM-6 Acoustic Microphone
- Cloudlifter CL-1
- Yamaha A-S801 Integrated Amplifier
- KEF LS50 Meta Speakers

## Overview

I use the Raspberry Pi like a hub, primarily powered by Home Assistant, serving not only as a home automation center but also as a dynamic information display and a music player. It has an attached touchscreen from Waveshare, which displays home information and the currently playing music, if any. The Raspberry Pi is also housed in a custom 3D-printed enclosure I made with Fusion 360. Lastly, it has a m.2 SSD plugged into the USB 3.0 for additional fast storage.

## Audio System

I am using Plexamp for my music player, since I use TIDAL and have a music collection of songs/mixtapes that I cannot get on streaming, so it provides a nice all in one spot for my music, and the interface looks great in the aspect ratio of the touchscreen.

To help with having to bear the weight of being the main source of audio in my home, I have the Raspberry Pi running CamillaDSP, a software for audio signal processing that I use with an acoustic microphone to tune my room and provide EQ to my Yamaha A-S801 integrated amplifier. The amplifier is connected to a pair of KEF LS50 Meta speakers. The end result is a fantastic sounding system that is tuned to my room and my preferences.

## Security

In terms of security, the Raspberry Pi is on its own VLAN along with the rest of my smart home devices. This is to segregate it from the rest of my network, ensuring that any potential vulnerabilities are isolated from the rest of my network.
